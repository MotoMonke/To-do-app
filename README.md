I never used readme files before. This time i decided to use it to know where i am in my project right now and what i have to do next.
    Key concepts of my project:
-Acces to local storage in browser +
-You can create projects, they are just objects with name key, and array of other objects +
-You can add TODO's to project(they are being stored in project array) +
-TODO's themsefs is an objects with:name,short description and due dates -
-TODO's can be added to project or to separate storage dedicated to non relative TODO's -
-In separate storage of app you can create, see and delet notes -
-Notes its just objects with title and text keys -
    Functionality of my project rn:
-I have 'create project' btn, project sidebar, ability to create, select the project and see it, ability to delete project
-Inside project i can add new todo and i can delete todo
-TODO's have name and date(right now it's just plain string, so i need to implement some kind of correct date selection dd/mm/yy)
